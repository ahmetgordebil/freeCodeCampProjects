                <p>Cambridge closes down because of the plague in London. Newton heads home. <br> He experiments with the
                    origin of colors and
                    the nature of gravity, and creates<br> what  we know as calculus today.

                <p>In 1684, a scientist urges Newton to write about how a planet moves in a certain orbit. His work
                    turns into a 3-volume
                    book known as Principia. Published in 1687, this work details the 3 laws of motion and the law of
                    universal gravitation.

                    “No one must think that Newton’s great creation can be overthrown in any real sense by this [Theory of Relativity] or by
                    any other theory. His clear and wide ideas will for ever retain their significance as the foundation on which our modern
                    conceptions of physics have been built.”<br>
